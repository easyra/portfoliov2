    text:`Lambda Notes is a note taking application that allows users to organize their information in an efficient manner. Users are able to post notes to a REST API and have those notes be displayed for everyone to see. Lambda Notes also has other features that create a more enjoyable experience for users such as support for premade themes, tagging support for notes, and the ability to search by note title or tag. I created this project using Reactjs, SQLite, Nodejs, and Expressjs.`,
